# Documenting
This is a guideline on how to write documentation comments.


## General
The general layout of a documentation comment is this:
```lua
--- This is the description of the function.
function SomeFunction() end

--- This is a longer description of a function
-- They can also be multiple lines long. Notice
-- how only the first line is appended to 3 dashes.
-- *Markdown* is also supported.
function SomeFunction2() end
```


## Parameters
If your function takes in parameters, you should also define in your documentation.\
**Note:** Class names should be named how they are listed [on the official Wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/).
This means the name for text will be `string`, but the class for a player will be `Player` (notice the casing).
```lua
--- This is a function that takes in two parameters.
-- @param paramA [string] - the first parameters description
-- @param paramB [string] - the second parameters description
function SomeFunction(paramA, paramB) end

--- Parameters can also have different types.
-- @param paramA [string|number] - the first parameter can either be a string or a number
-- @param paramB [any] - the second parameter can literally be anything
function SomeFunction2(paramA, paramB) end

--- Parameters can also have fallback types.
-- @param paramA [string|number] (=64) - the first parameter will default to 64 when not supplied
-- @param paramB [any] (='Hello World!') - the second parameter will default to 'Hello World!' when not supplied
function SomeFunction3(paramA, paramB) end
```


## Return values
Returns values work very similar to parameters.
```lua
--- This is a function that returns value.
-- @returns id [string] - the generated id
function SomeFunction() end

--- This function returns multiple values.
-- @returns team [string] - the name of the team
-- @returns players [table] - a table containing all players part of the team
function SomeFunction2() end
```


## Special fields

### Deprecated
You can easily mark functions as deprecated using the `@deprecated` keyword.
```lua
--- This function is deprecated.
-- @deprecated
function PLAYER:SomeFunction() end

--- You can also specify instructions on how to handle this.
-- @deprecated use PLAYER:SomeFunction3() instead
function PLAYER:SomeFunction3() end
```

### Internal
You can also mark functions as internal using the `@internal` keyword.
```lua
--- This is an internal function.
-- @internal
function PLAYER:SomeFunction() end

--- This is an internal function with instructions.
-- @internal use PLAYER:SomeFunction3() instead
function PLAYER:SomeFunction2() end
```

### Notes
You can also add notes to your function.
```lua
--- Another cool function.
-- @note This function only works on sandbox derived gamemodes.
function SomeFunction() end
```
You can also add multiple notes if you wish to do so.

### Alias
If your function is an alias, you can simply use the `@aliasof` keyword.
No other description is required.
```lua
--- Returns the Steam username of this player.
-- @returns nick [string] - the steam username
function PLAYER:Nick() end

--- @aliasof Player:Nick
function PLAYER:Name() end
```

### Author
If you want to specify an author for a function to contact in case of questions, etc.
you can do so using the `@author` keyword.
```lua
--- This cool function has been created by me!
-- @author Tassilo <tassia710@gmail.com>
function SomeFunction() end
```
**Note:** You don't have specify your email. A link to your website, your GitHub profile, your
Steam profile or anything else is also possible. However you should include a method to contact you.

### Since
If you wish to specify the release since when a function is available you can easily do so.\
**Note:** The release name should match a GitHub release or tag.
```lua
--- This function is available since release v3.0.4.
-- @since v3.0.4
function SomeFunction() end
```

### Realm
You can also override the realm for a function. If this is not supplied, the parser will asusme the realm
depending on your file prefix (`cl_`, `sh_` or `sv_`).
```lua
--- This function is only available serverside.
-- @realm server
function SomeFunction() end
```


## Hooks
All the documentation rules also apply to hooks.
```lua
--- Called upon an animation event, this is the ideal place to call player animation functions
-- such as Player:AddVCDSequenceToGestureSlot, Player:AnimRestartGesture and so on.
-- @param ply [Player] - Player who is being animated
-- @param event [number] - Animation event. See Enums/PLAYERANIMEVENT
-- @param data [number] (=0) - The data for the event. This is interpreted as an Enums/ACT by `PLAYERANIMEVENT_CUSTOM` and `PLAYERANIMEVENT_CUSTOM_GESTURE`, or a sequence by `PLAYERANIMEVENT_CUSTOM_SEQUENCE`.
-- @returns activity [number] - The translated activity to send to the weapon. See Enums/ACT. Return `ACT_INVALID` if you don't want to send an activity.
hook.Run("DoAnimationEvent", ply, event, data)
```


## Network strings
You can also document network strings if you like.
```lua
--- This is called to make a notification popup on the client.
-- @direction SV --> CL
util.AddNetworkString("Notify")
```
**Note:** The `@direction` keyword can have either `SV --> CL`, `SV <-- CL` or `SV <-> CL` as value. If something else
is present or the keyword as a whole is absent, `SV <-> CL` is assumed.
